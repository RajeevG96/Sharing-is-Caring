        <p>He did this because whilst working for the NSA he found out that alongside other government intelligence agencies like GCHQ (UK) and the NSA (USA) were <span class="highlighted">collecting massive amounts of digital data from ordinary internet users</span> from all over the world i.e metadata via their internet connected devices and free online services. </p>

        <h2 class="centeredtext">How?</h2>

        <h3>Intelligence agencies such as GCHQ and NSA have sophisticated hacking technology which is used to track and analyse YOU.</h3>
